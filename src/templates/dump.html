        <h2>What is Sudoku?</h2>
        <p>Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Play Sudoku</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Each puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid with several given numbers.</li>
          <li>The goal is to fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains each digit exactly once.</li>
          <li>Use logic and deduction to solve the puzzle, eliminating possibilities until only one option remains for each cell.</li>
          <li>The puzzle is solved when the entire grid is filled with valid numbers.</li>
